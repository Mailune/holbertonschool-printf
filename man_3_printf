printf(3)				Custom printf Manual				printf(3)

NAME
       printf - formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include <main.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf function formats and prints data under control of the format string format.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

       The conversion specifications are introduced by the character % and consist of the following components:

       %c     Print a character.

       %s     Print a string.

       %d, %i Print an integer in decimal format.

       %%     Print a percent sign.

       Unsupported or invalid conversion specifications result in undefined behavior.

EXAMPLES

           _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
           _printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);
           return 0;
       }

       The above program will output:

       Hello, world!
       The answer is 42.
